I am Yicheng Song, a Junior majoring in Economics and Data Science. I have hardly done anything with any Databases. However, as for code frameworks, I have tried Scrapy and FastAPI in my course projects, which require us to do data collection and analysis on the financial system. The project I am quite proud of is the a simulated banking system where I am mainly reponsible for the programming of transactions.
